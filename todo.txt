I will try to do this in two steps, the first one being a lot easier than the second one.

METHOD ONE
1) Get all the .wav files with less or equal to 20 seconds and their transcriptions
2) Get them in the correct CSV file

DIFFERENT STEPS
1) Call the program with the top-level directory. Optionally, give a preferred component. Optionally, choose only flemish/dutch
2) If no component, is selected, we go over all components
3) If no language is selected we go over all languages
3) Take the path to the .wav file and write it
4) Get the filesize and write it
5) Get the corresponding transcription and write it
6) Close the file and save it

METHOD TWO
1) Check the .wav file. If it is less than or equal to 20 seconds, thats fine
2) If not, break up the .wav in several .wavs using the annotation time stamps
2) Now get them correctly in the CSV file
